## Keyword Spotting Models for Voice Control Applications

- [`keyword_spotting`](./keyword_spotting/) contains models for detecting the spoken words "on" and "off" from spectrogram data. These can be used with the Gecko SDK example application [Voice Control Light](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/gecko_sdk/tree/gsdk_4.1/app/common/example/voice_control_light) for keyword spotting using microphone data on supported boards.
